# roll-op 

`roll-op` is an open-source script that allows to spin up an OP stack rollup infrastructure by running only a few commands, and using a single configuration file. The package supports spinning a block explorer (Blockscout).

In this branch roll-op has been modified to 
- consume 0 gas
- write data to a database as a Data Availability layer insted of the L1 chain.

The roll-op project was supported by an [Optimism governance grant](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/proposals?id=a6e6bfb8-75bd-41bd-acb1-618c3c62e667).

## Versioning

The current version deploys software pinned to the following branches:

- Optimism Monorepo: [`op-node/feat/da-db-v2 `](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/tree/feat/da-db-v2) 
- op-geth: [`op-geth/feat/0gas`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/tree/feat/0gas)

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10 (to run the `roll.py` script) with pip
  - `sudo apt install python3-pip` on Debian-based systems
  - `brew install python` on macOS with Homebrew

You also need the following installed, `rollop` will warn you if these are missing:

- Some common command line utilities: `make`, `curl`, `tar`, `awk` and `grep`.
- [`logrotate`](https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate)
  - `sudo apt install logrotate` on Debian-based systems
  - `brew install logrotate` on macOS with Homebrew
- Git
- Docker (if you wish to run the Blockscout block explorer)

`rollop` will check the following dependencies and install them for you if needed (the script will
always ask for your permission before installing anything outside the current directory):

- Python libraries
  - [Tomli](https://pypi.org/project/tomli/)
  - [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) (for block explorer support)
  - These will be installed globally by default. To install them locally instead (in a venv within
    the roll-op directory), you can run `source devenv.sh` before running `rollbop`.
- Node.js 20.9.0
- pnpm (`pnpm install -g pnpm`)
- Yarn (for account abstraction support)
  (`npm install -g yarn` â€” the old one, not yarn v3 aka yarn berry)
- Geth >= 1.13.4 (but only if you want to run a devnet L1 node)
- The `jq` command line utility
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
- Go >= 1.21


### docker compose

The `docker compose plugin` is required. Note this differs from `docker-compose`. The presence of the plugin can be checked with
```
docker compose version
```
For manual installation refer the bottom of the [official instalation description](
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).

## Usage

For a complete usage guide refer the [original README](https://github.com/apenzk/roll-op/). Here we only list the below examples.

### Starting all services

```
./rollop setup --yes && ./rollop --clean --name=myTestnet --preset=dev --config=config.toml.example devnet --yes
```

The following starts network but sometimes the network is not fully responsive
```
./rollop --name=myTestnet --preset=dev --config=config.toml.example devnet
```

### Issuing transactions

To check balances and send a tx run 
```
npm install ethers
node myTestScripts.js
```

### Explorer

A blockscout explorer is provided. To start the explorer clean, use
```
./rollop explorer --clean
```
For a simple restart use
```
./rollop explorer --config=config.toml.example
```
